# Project Proposal:

This project is based off of the game Genshin Impact which has characters that have the powers from their **elements**,
there are seven elements; **Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, Electro, Hydro, Anemo and Geo**. These seven elements may interact with
each other to create **elemental reactions**. This project will be a fighting sim that gives the user characters
to pick from, the user will pick four characters to be placed on their team. The user will then be given a randomized enemy
that has a health bar. The user, kind of like pokemon style, will pick abilities from each character to react with
one another. Once the sequence of abilities is submitted an elemental reaction will occur and depending on which, will do
more damage to the enemy.

## User Usage
The expected user to use this application are people who want to understand elemental reactions in the game better. Some
reactions in the game deal less damage than others, and some elements do not react with each other at all. By playing around
with this application, the user gets a better understanding of how elemental reactions work in Genshin and may apply
this to their own teams in the actual game.

## Interest

I have been playing Genshin ever since it came out and throughout the years I have been slowly building my understanding
of artifact builds, reactions, team building, etc. This game has quickly become something I am passionate about and
something I am knowledgeable about as well.
