# Project Proposal:
This project is based off of the game Genshin Impact. The game has characters that derive powers from seven different **elements; Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, Electro, Hydro, Anemo and Geo.** These seven elements may interact with each other to create **elemental reactions,** which can have different damage multipliers on enemies when combined together in a certain sequence. This project will be an infinite fighting sim that allows the user to create characters to be placed on their team composition. The user will then be given a fixed 100 hp enemy to test these reactions. Similar to pokemon or other turn-based games (excluding the enemy's ability to fight back), the user will pick abilities from each character to react with one another in pairs. Once the sequence of abilities is submitted an elemental reaction will occur, depending on which one is produced it will do more/less/or no damage to the enemy.

## User Usage
The expected user to utilize this application are people who want to understand elemental reactions in the game better. Some reactions in the game deal more damage, less damage, and some elements do not react with each other at all. By playing around with this application, the user gets a better understanding of how elemental reactions work in Genshin Impact and may apply this to their own teams in the actual game.

## Interest
Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game created by the game company miHoYo. It utilizes an open world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental abilties and character-switching. Since its release in 2020, I have been playing consistently nearly everyday. I have a strong understanding of artifact builds, reactions (interactions/damage multipliers between elements), team building, etc. I consume a lot of Genshin Impact media, which includes guide-making, theory crafting, and even lengthy lore videos. This game has quickly become a big passion point for me. Furthermore, I am interested in creating more tools to make the game, which can be overwhelming because of its complex battling system, more accessible and convenient for all players.
